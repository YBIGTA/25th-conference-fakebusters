# MM-Det Inference Code

This code is originally from [SparkleXFantasy/MM-Det](https://github.com/SparkleXFantasy/MM-Det).  
The test code has been revised to support inference, and additional inference functionality has been added.

## How to Use

### 1. Download the weight from
```bash

### 2. Inference
To perform inference, following the command. 

```bash
python main.py -v video_path
```

if inference went succesfully, you can see

### 3. Minimum GPU Memory
GPU must have > 48Gb memory or 24GB * 2

### 4. If you want to make inference api
```bash
cd /25th-conference-fakebusters/model/MM_Det
python -m inference.main_fastapi 
```
then it will works on port 8000
